Workload skew report

Skew information will only be generated if:
 - there is more than one Workload Definition (WD/FWD)
 - there is more than one Storage Definition (SD/FSD)
 - there is more than one Host
 - there is more than one Slave
(Though these rules may be ignored from time to time).

23:57:04.017 Calculated versus requested workload skew. (Delta only shown if > 0.10% absolute)
23:57:04.017 Note that for an Uncontrolled MAX run workload skew is irrelevant.
23:57:04.017 This was an Uncontrolled MAX run.
